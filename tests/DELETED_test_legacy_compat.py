"""
Legacy Compatibility Test Scaffold
Sprint 2.3 - QA Lead: Pete

Tests for legacy code that has been retained, deferred, or requires
compatibility checking. Protects against regressions in older features
while new systems are being developed.

Focus Areas:
- Shadow scoring logic (if retained)
- Unused journal scoring mechanisms  
- Tool feedback stubs and placeholders
- Deferred Phase 3 features that must remain stable
