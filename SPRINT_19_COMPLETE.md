[WORKFLOW] Persona Creation Pipeline:

1. Upload Files -> POST /api/fission/upload
   (PDF, TXT, JSON, CSV, images, audio)

2. Extract Features -> POST /api/fission/ingest/{session_id}
   (Personality traits, archetypes, memories)

3. Fuse Blueprint -> POST /api/fission/fuse/{session_id}
   (Generate complete persona specification)

4. Preview/Refine -> GET /api/fission/preview/{persona_name}
   (Review traits, add memories, adjust boundaries)

5. Deploy to VALIS -> POST /api/fission/deploy/{persona_name}
   (Activate in consciousness runtime)

[STATUS] Current System Status:
- Ingestion Engine: Operational with 11 format parsers
- Fusion Engine: Operational with confidence scoring
- API Server: Ready to launch on port 8001
- Test Suite: 100% pass rate, all components verified
