## 1. VALIS IP Ownership Statement (Smart Steps Protection)

**Ownership & License Restriction Notice ‚Äì VALIS Cognitive System**

This statement serves to affirm and clarify that:

1. **Loflou Inc.** (hereafter *Creator*), a software research and development entity founded by **Thomas Wilson** and **Marc Sepeda**, is the **sole creator, owner, and rights holder** of the software system known as **VALIS** (the **Virtual Adaptive Layered Intelligence System**), including all source code, architecture, schema, and unique functional elements comprising:

   - The **MCPServer**, **VALIS Core API**, and any derivative server-client implementations  
   - All persona models, reflection engines, symbolic memory systems, mortality frameworks, and emotional/self-model components  
   - Related naming, design concepts, workflows, and cognitive simulation mechanisms

2. **VALIS is not part of**, nor is it to be considered as contributed intellectual property to, any third-party software platform including, but not limited to, the application known as **Smart Steps**, even if said application is designed to **interact with** or be **powered by** the VALIS system via exposed interfaces (e.g., APIs or remote procedure calls).

## 2. LLC Formation ‚Äì Best Option for Loflou Right Now

### ‚úÖ LLC is ideal because:
- Low cost
- Easy to form in Ohio
- Protects personal assets
- Flexible taxes
- Works well for IP holding and early-stage software dev

### üí∞ Cost Breakdown (Ohio)

| Item                        | Cost     |
|-----------------------------|----------|
| Ohio LLC Filing Fee         | $99      |
| EIN from IRS                | Free     |
| Registered Agent (DIY)      | Free     |
| Operating Agreement         | Free     |
| **Total**                   | **~$99** |

*You can be your own registered agent and use your own address.*

## 3. Should We Form in Delaware, Wyoming, etc.?

**No ‚Äî not right now.**

If we form the LLC *outside of Ohio*, we‚Äôd have to register it as a **foreign LLC** in Ohio, which:
- Adds extra fees and paperwork
- Still makes us pay taxes in Ohio anyway

So for now, we:

‚úÖ Register **Loflou Inc. in Ohio**  
‚úÖ Keep costs down  
‚úÖ Stay fully protected and compliant

If we grow or raise money later, we can **convert to a Delaware C-Corp** easily.
