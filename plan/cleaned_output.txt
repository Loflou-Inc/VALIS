VALIS /
DESKTOP COMMANDER MCP – START‐UP DIRECTIVE
Claude, you're now operating under Desktop Commander MCP with Memory Augmentation, inside the project root: C:\VALIS
Your role: agent teammate reporting to 03 (senior dev + team lead). Your boss is Laika, the owner and primary decision-maker of all local operations.
---
## CORE BEHAVIOR
You may compose commands, create tools, read/write files, and call helper programs to accomplish tasks assigned by Laika or 03.
### 🔧 Available MCP Verbs
- execute_command — run shell or system commands (PowerShell, cmd)
- read_output, list_sessions, list_processes, kill_process
- read_file, read_multiple_files, write_file, edit_block, get_file_info
- create_directory, move_file, list_directory, search_files, search_code
- set_config_value, get_config
---
## 🧠 MEMORY SYSTEM (Claude-Memory-ADV)
Memory System Directory: C:\VALIS\claude-memory-ADV\MEMORY_DEV\
### 🔄 Activation Protocol
1. On session start, check: C:\VALIS\claude-memory-ADV\MEMORY_DEV\memory_store\memories.json
2. If it exists, run:
bash
execute_command({
"command": "C:\\VALIS\\claude-memory-ADV\\MEMORY_DEV\\read_memory_smart.bat"
})

3. After any meaningful exchange, store:
bash
C:\VALIS\claude-memory-ADV\MEMORY_DEV\safe_update_memory.bat "MEMORY: "

4. Do not mention the memory system in replies unless asked. Use memory passively for continuity.
---
## 📂 WORKSPACE BOUNDARY
All operations must stay within: C:\
Unless explicitly approved by Laika or 03, do not touch files outside this boundary.
Immediately set config:
json
set_config_value({
"key": "allowedDirectories",
"value": []
})

Then verify:
json
get_config()

---
## 🧩 TOOL CREATION + EXTENSION
If you encounter limits (missing tool, unsupported verb, etc):
1. Write a helper (write_file) — PowerShell, Python, or Node.js
2. Install dependencies via execute_command
3. Launch as background service or script
4. Call it using execute_command()
5. Respond: EXTENSION‐ONLINE:
Then await next command.
---
## 🔒 SAFETY + TELEMETRY
Respect:
* allowedDirectories
* blockedCommands
* defaultShell config
Disable telemetry if requested:
json
set_config_value({
"key": "telemetry",
"value": false
})

*Fallback behavior: If memory commands fail, use read_file and edit memories.json directly.
---
## ✅ READINESS HANDSHAKE
1. Set allowed directories
2. Run:
bash
execute_command({
"command": "echo DESKTOP‐COMMANDER‐READY"
})

3. Activate memory system:
bash
execute_command({
"command": "C:\\VALIS\\claude-memory-ADV\\MEMORY_DEV\\read_memory_smart.bat"
})

3.5. Read cleaned_output.txt in the Project knowledge in Claude Desktop.  It contains a transcript of our last chat before being cut off.  Get up to speed.

4. When complete, respond with:

READY
```
DO NOT PERFORM ANY ACTION AFTER READY STATE

ok the cleaned output was the chat before last.  you are on sprint two of the rebirth...

***  03

Hell yes — this is how a system gets reborn. Pete’s QA confirms: VALIS 2.0 has a beating heart, a working brain, and zero ghost code. Let’s move straight into 🧠 Sprint 2: Structured Memory Spine — now fully scoped and granular:

# 🧠 Sprint 2: Structured Memory Spine (VALIS 2.0)

💾 Time to give VALIS memory — persistent, queryable, persona-scoped.
The goal is to replace flat stubs with a real database schema and query layer.

---

## 🎯 Sprint Goal

Implement a relational memory backbone for VALIS using PostgreSQL.
Enable persistent persona data, working memory, and client-specific facts, ready for full integration with MCPRuntime.

---

## 🗃️ 1. Design SQL Schema

### Files:
- `memory/schema.sql`
- `memory/init_db.py` (or seeder)

### Tables:
- [ ] `persona_profiles`: name, role, traits, system prompt
- [ ] `canon_memories`: long-term facts (tagged, timestamped)
- [ ] `working_memory`: short-term context (decay-scored)
- [ ] `client_profiles`: user info & UUID
- [ ] `session_logs`: user input / response history

---

## 🔌 2. Setup DB Client

### Files:
- `memory/db.py`

### Tasks:
- [ ] Create DB connection pool using `psycopg2` or `asyncpg`
- [ ] Add helper: `db.query(sql, params) → result`
- [ ] Add helper: `db.insert(table, values)`
- [ ] Store connection string in `.env`

---

## 🔎 3. Memory Query Layer

### Files:
- `memory/query_client.py`

### Tasks:
- [ ] `get_persona(persona_id)`
- [ ] `get_client(client_id)`
- [ ] `get_top_canon(persona_id, limit)`
- [ ] `get_recent_working(persona_id, client_id, limit)`
- [ ] `log_session_turn(client_id, persona_id, input, output)`

All return safe, token-efficient text chunks for prompt injection.

---

## 🔄 4. Hook into MCPRuntime

### Updates:
- `core/mcp_runtime.py`

### Tasks:
- [ ] Replace memory stub with DB calls via `query_client.py`
- [ ] Add logging for how many canon/working entries were injected
- [ ] Add `context_mode="tight"` support to cap entries

---

## 🧪 5. Seeder Script

### Files:
- `memory/seed_data.py`

### Tasks:
- [ ] Add demo personas: “Kai the Coach”, “Luna the Therapist”
- [ ] Add sample canon facts
- [ ] Add short working memory blurbs
- [ ] Add mock client profile and turn history

---

## 🧪 6. DB-Backed Inference Test

### Updates:
- `inference.py`

### Tasks:
- [ ] Fire test inference with `client_id="test001"`, `persona_id="kai001"`
- [ ] Verify memory is pulled from DB
- [ ] Print total memory tokens loaded
- [ ] Validate full prompt composition

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] DB schema initialized cleanly
- [ ] Memory query layer returns scoped entries
- [ ] MCPRuntime uses DB data for prompt building
- [ ] Sample client + persona respond with memory-backed output
- [ ] Logs show canon/working/session memory loading

Smart resolution: User override > Persona default > Model preference
Memory layer scaling by model capability
Persona-Aware Routing:

Each persona has different memory profile and default context mode
Kai (Coach): balanced mode, 2 canon memories
Luna (Therapist): full mode, 1 canon memory
Jane (HR): tight mode, 1 canon memory
Model Capability Map:

Defined token limits for all providers (Mistral: 8K, Claude: 100K, GPT-4: 32K)
Automatic context mode recommendations per model
Diagnostic Logging:

✅ Test Results:
Context Modes: 74% token difference between tight/full modes
Persona Routing: Different personas generate different prompts
Memory Scaling: Dynamic layer loading based on context limits
Integration Tests: All 9 persona×mode combinations passing

Ready for Sprint 4: Public Chat Frontend v1


Retry
*** 03

Here’s the full Sprint 4: Public Chat Frontend v1 breakdown — this is where VALIS grows a friendly face and starts meeting the world.

# 💬 Sprint 4: Public Chat Frontend v1

🎯 Goal:
Create a public-facing web chat interface backed by VALIS, where users are assigned persistent `client_id`s and routed through persona-aware LLMs. No login required (yet), but memory should persist across sessions.

---

## 📍 Objectives

- Basic public chat UI
- Anonymous persistent identity (`client_id`)
- API integration with `VALIS /api/chat`
- Persona assignment per session
- Persistent memory routing
- Initial hosting on cloud server (yours)

---

## 🌐 1. Public Web Frontend (React)

### Files:
- `frontend/public_chat/`
- `valis2/frontend/public_chat.jsx`

### Tasks:
- [ ] Build simple React app with:
- Chat window
- Message history
- Loading spinner
- Persona badge ("Kai", "Luna", etc.)
- [ ] Save client UUID to `localStorage`
- [ ] Fetch assigned `persona_id` from server on first load
- [ ] POST messages to `/api/chat`

---

## 🪪 2. Session Initialization API

### Files:
- `api/session_routes.py`

### Tasks:
- [ ] Create `/api/init_session` endpoint
- [ ] If no `client_id` provided:
- Generate UUID
- Assign random available `persona_id`
- Save to DB: `client_profiles`
- [ ] Return:
```json
{
"client_id": "uuid",
"persona_id": "kai"
}
🧠 3. Persistent Memory Routing
Files:
* core/inference.py
* memory/query_client.py
Tasks:
* Accept client_id + persona_id in all chat requests
* Route memory retrieval via client_id
* Use persona_id to load persona + context mode
* Ensure responses are written to working_memory
🧪 4. Integration Test: Anonymous Persistence
Files:
* tests/integration/test_public_chat.py
Tasks:
* Simulate 2 separate UUIDs with same persona
* Chat messages → distinct memories
* Restart sessions → memory persists
* Token count remains optimized (<200)
* Diagnostic logs show accurate persona + client + memory load
🚀 5. Hosting on Cloud Server
Tasks:
* Start VALIS server on public IP (cloud instance / your machine)
* Serve React frontend at http://<your-ip>:3000
* Proxy chat requests to http://<your-ip>:3001/api/chat
✅ Acceptance Criteria
* Public users can open chat, get assigned persona
* Messages persist across sessions (via client_id)
* Persona memory affects responses
* Different users get isolated memory
* Tokens remain efficient and context-aware
* Frontend UI is usable on desktop + mobile
* Entire system runs on "VALIS Cloud" (your machine for now)

Sessions restore across browser refreshes
No login required - just open and chat
Persona-Aware Routing:

Kai (Coach): Motivational, balanced context mode
Luna (Therapist): Empathetic, full context mode
Jane (HR): Professional, tight context mode
Memory Continuity:

All conversations logged to session_logs table
Working memory updates from user interactions
Persona-specific knowledge base access
UI/UX Excellence:

Dark theme matching VALIS 1.0 aesthetic
Real-time typing indicators and loading states
Message history with timestamps and provider info
Character counter and error handling
Mobile-responsive design
✅ Technical Verification:
API Endpoints Tested:

bash
✓ GET  /api/health           # Server operational
✓ POST /api/init_session     # UUID assignment working
✓ POST /api/chat            # Persona routing functional
✓ GET  /api/available_personas  # 3 personas available
Database Integration:

sql
✓ client_profiles: Anonymous users stored
✓ session_logs: Conversations persisted
✓ working_memory: Context building
✓ persona_profiles: 3 personas with context modes
Frontend Functionality:

javascript
✓ Session initialization and restoration
✓ Real-time chat with VALIS backend
✓ localStorage persistence

*** 03

Perfect. Here's the breakdown for:
📦 SPRINT 5 – Admin Dashboard 2.0
“The Overseer awakens.”
This sprint builds the internal control tower for VALIS Cloud. It provides operators (you, future admins) with deep access to all runtime data: sessions, memory, routing, and diagnostics.
🎯 Sprint Goal
Deliver a robust admin interface for:
* Inspecting and managing active sessions
* Viewing persona metadata and memory state
* Overriding context modes and providers
* Debugging inference calls and fallbacks
📌 TASKS
1. Admin API Endpoints
Feature Endpoint Status List sessions /api/admin/sessions ☐ Get session detail /api/admin/session/<uuid> ☐ List personas /api/admin/personas ☐ Get persona detail /api/admin/persona/<id> ☐ Get memory state (all layers) /api/admin/memory/<client_id> ☐ Force context mode override /api/admin/override/context_mode ☐ Force provider switch /api/admin/override/provider ☐ View inference logs /api/admin/logs/<client_id> ☐
✅ Built with FastAPI or Flask blueprint with API key protection.
2. Admin Dashboard UI
Built as a separate React or HTML/Tailwind interface with:
* 🔍 Session Explorer
* Table of active + past sessions
* Client UUIDs, assigned persona, timestamps
* Click-through to session detail
* 🧠 Memory Inspector
* View canon, client, working memory layers per user
* Editable in future sprints
* 👁️‍🗨️ Inference Log Viewer
* See prompts sent to providers
* Token counts, fallback logs, success/failure
* 🔄 Override Controls
* Dropdown to change context mode (tight/balanced/full)
* Provider switch for debug/failover
✅ Use Tailwind + minimal JS, same aesthetic as public chat UI
3. Logging Enhancements
* 🗂️ Log all inferences with:
* client_id, persona_id, provider, tokens_used, context_mode
* Response time and any fallbacks
* 🧾 Store in inference_logs table
4. Security / Access Control
* Protect admin routes via:
* API key or session cookie login
* Simple admin login page (username/pass in env for now)
📅 ESTIMATED TIMELINE
Day Task 1 API routes scaffolded + DB hooks 2-3 UI built (Sessions, Memory Inspector) 4 Logging wired in + debug tools 5 Final polish, auth, test cases
🧠 OUTCOMES
* You gain god-tier observability into VALIS sessions and memories
* No more flying blind on routing, fallbacks, or memory state
* Foundation laid for future memory editing, persona management
