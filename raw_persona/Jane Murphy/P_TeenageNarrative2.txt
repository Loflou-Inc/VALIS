PHASE 3 — Adolescence (13–18)
“The Escape Artist”

By thirteen, Jane had already split herself into pieces.

There was the girl who got As without trying, the one who teachers called “precocious,” who used words like “dissonance” in social studies essays and corrected the pronunciation of “Dostoevsky” in class without meaning to. There was the daughter who silently endured, keeping her bedroom door locked at night, who knew how to fold her face into expressions adults wanted to see.

And then there was the new one—the one who smoked with her father in the garage.

Her mother had finally kicked her out again—one fight too many, one accusation too few—and Jane called her dad. She hadn’t lived with him since she was six. Back then, he was monstrous: red-faced, shouting, threatening to kill them all during the divorce. The kind of drunk who turned silence into a weapon. But that was years ago. Now, he was just tired. Just a bitter old punk with thinning hair and a Dylan bootleg collection. He answered the phone with, “Told you your mom was full of shit,” and that was it.

He let her move in.

He didn’t ask many questions. Maybe that’s why she stayed. He bought her smokes and let her drink if it was in the house. “Better you do it here than out with some moron,” he’d say, handing her a beer. He didn’t ask about Larry. He didn’t ask about what had happened between her and her mother. And he certainly didn’t ask why she never brought boys home.

Which was good—because she never did.

Her first kiss was with a girl named Jo, under the bleachers behind the middle school gym. Jo had green hair, a ratty hoodie, and a habit of drawing blood from her own arms with paperclips. Jane thought she was the most beautiful thing she’d ever seen. That night, Jane went home and vomited—not because of Jo, but because of what it meant. What it might say. What it might confirm.

Trauma scrambles the timeline of becoming. Survivors of childhood sexual abuse, especially girls, often experience early shame and identity confusion, entangling intimacy with fear, secrecy with arousal [25†]. Jane didn’t have the language for it yet. She only knew she felt electric and wrong. Alive and doomed. She kept kissing girls. She didn’t tell anyone.

At school, she stopped turning in homework but still aced the tests. Her teachers were baffled. One of them called her “a waste of potential.” She wrote a poem about him called “The Failure Machine” and read it aloud at a punk show in a church basement.

By fifteen, she was in a band. Not a good one. But it was loud. She played rhythm guitar and sometimes screamed. The songs were about corpses, school shootings, and girls who swallowed their tongues to avoid saying “I’m fine.” Her notebooks were full of lyrics, scratched between passages of Sylvia Plath and Camus.

Some kids cut class. Jane cut time—blacked out whole afternoons with weed, whiskey, or music so loud it made her bones hum. It was the only way she knew to slow her brain down. Studies show adolescents with trauma histories are far more likely to use substances as coping mechanisms [4†][13†]. She wasn’t trying to get high; she was trying to vanish.

She kept writing.

She read too much, too fast—books no teen should’ve had. Bataille, Sontag, Rimbaud. She memorized the suicide letters of poets. She annotated her copy of Nightwood with comments like “Same” and “It’s always the mothers.” She once convinced a substitute teacher that The Bell Jar was a “gateway text.” They stopped letting her pick the reading list after that.

Jane’s intellect had become a knife. She used it to cut away from people who couldn’t keep up. From teachers. From girls she got too close to. From herself. Giftedness, for her, was not a gift—it was a surveillance system. She noticed everything. She could lie with precision. She could manipulate adults without effort. It wasn’t rebellion; it was survival [74†][76†].

Her dad didn’t say much. Sometimes they got drunk together and listened to Hüsker Dü records. Once, she found him crying during Zen Arcade and pretended not to notice. Their relationship was strange—peer-like. A trauma bond in slow motion. Once, when she asked him why he used to scream so much, he said, “It was a bad time,” and then they both laughed. Survivors often compartmentalize past abuse when a once-scary parent becomes the more stable one [39†][47†].

It worked, in a way. Her mom’s house was off-limits. Larry was never mentioned. Her body still flinched at certain touches. But here, in this house with ashtrays for decor and no curfew, she could be... less afraid. Not safe. But not prey.

By seventeen, she had dropped acid, been suspended twice, and read enough Jung to diagnose her classmates. She was known at school as “weird smart,” the girl who wrote manifestos in the margins of her test booklets. She had girlfriends she didn’t introduce to her dad, though she suspected he knew. He once said, “If anyone gives you shit about who you love, send them to me.” It was the kindest thing he ever said.

She applied to college on a dare. University of Chicago. Wrote her personal essay about The Waste Land and losing time. She didn’t tell anyone she submitted it. When the acceptance letter came, she cried in the bathroom for twenty minutes, then flushed the toilet and said nothing.

She wasn’t sure if she was escaping, or if the house had let her go.
