PHASE 5 — Graduate School (24–33)
“The Analyst and the Analyzed”

It was one thing to survive a childhood of pain.
It was another to catalog it.

By 24, Jane had traded her amp for a laptop, her leather jacket for a battered blazer. Northwestern accepted her with funding, a thin letter that somehow felt heavier than any weight she'd carried up until then. She read it alone, sitting on the floor of her sublet, knees pulled to her chest, trying not to feel anything. That had been her goal lately. To feel less.

The first year of her PhD program blurred by in a cocktail of caffeine, whiskey, psychodynamic theory, and sleeplessness. She learned how to write like a grant proposal. How to dress like she hadn’t been up all night. How to keep her voice steady when a client reminded her of herself.

What no one prepared her for was how much grad school would escalate everything. Not just the stress, but the symptoms. The dreams. The panic in grocery store aisles. The crying jags she couldn’t explain. The dissociation that returned with a vengeance whenever she role-played intake interviews.

Clients would sit across from her and speak their pain—and sometimes it was like the air in the room curdled. Her chest would go tight. Her hearing would fuzz. She once ended a session ten minutes early because a boy mentioned “my mom’s boyfriend,” and the floor dropped out beneath her. She smiled through it. Took notes. Went home and drank herself to sleep.
(Emotional flooding and countertransference are common in trainees with trauma histories. Survivors often dissociate or over-identify with clients who echo their own pasts .)

She started therapy in her second year, not because she wanted to—but because her supervisor quietly suggested it after Jane froze during a practicum session. Therapy felt like a dare. Like getting undressed in public. She spent the first three sessions intellectualizing everything: trauma as narrative disorganization, PTSD as memory retrieval gone wrong, dissociation as a failure of affect regulation.

Her therapist called her on it. “You’re using jargon to avoid feeling.”

Jane laughed. “I’m in a PhD program. What else do you think I’m paying for?”
(Trauma-exposed trainees often intellectualize as a defense. This avoids emotional processing but delays integration .)

She was drinking more again. Quietly. Socially. Late at night, in the quiet between case reports. Not enough to be noticed. But enough to blur. Trauma survivors in high-pressure academic settings often relapse or escalate substance use as a form of control—an effort to manage symptoms silently while keeping up appearances .

And she was keeping up. That was the thing. Her coursework was immaculate. Her professors called her “rigorous,” “thoughtful,” “astute.” One even called her “clinical dynamite.” She received early approval for her dissertation concept: Narcissistic Vulnerability and PTSD in the Therapeutic Dyad. She said it was inspired by client cases. She didn’t say it was about herself.

But inside, she was crumbling.

Every compliment made her skin itch. Every published article made her want to disappear. She didn’t understand why she couldn’t believe the praise. She kept waiting for someone to realize she wasn’t that smart. That she was just tricking them.
(Impostor syndrome is especially common in high-achieving women with trauma histories. They often internalize success as a fluke, fearing exposure as frauds .)

Her friends—if you could call them that—talked about their “imposter moments” like jokes. Jane didn’t laugh. For her, it was a daily exorcism: wake up, be smarter than the pain, perform excellence, collapse.

She started avoiding eye contact in therapy. She grew distant from clients who disclosed abuse. She stopped crying, even when she needed to. Burnout felt like success with all the marrow sucked out.
(Vicarious trauma and burnout are common in students with unresolved trauma, often leading to dissociation, numbness, and boundary issues .)

By year five, Jane had begun assembling the core of her dissertation, and with it, a myth: that she understood narcissism not because she was vulnerable, but because she had conquered it. That she was studying PTSD not because she still woke up in sweat, but because she was ready to move on.

She told her advisor, “I want to look at what happens when therapists are containers for stories they once lived.” Her advisor raised an eyebrow. “Is this a personal interest?”

Jane smiled. “Aren’t they all?”
