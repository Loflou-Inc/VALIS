PHASE 2 — Middle Childhood (7–12)
“The Ghost in the Room”

Jane doesn’t remember the first time he touched her. Not clearly. It wasn’t cinematic. It didn’t crash into her like a car accident or scream itself into her ears like her father’s threats had. It crept.

He was quiet about it. That’s what made it worse.

Her stepfather, Larry, moved in when she was seven. Her mom said, “This is a fresh start,” as if lives were dry erase boards. Jane already knew that was bullshit. She didn’t say it out loud, of course. She didn’t say much at all.

At school, Jane was the kind of student teachers loved but couldn’t quite place. She finished reading assignments before the class was halfway through, often staring out the window while the others were still mouthing syllables. But she never acted out. She was polite. So bright. So “mature for her age.” They meant it as a compliment. She knew it meant something else.

That was the year she began to disappear. Not physically. Just… from herself. Sometimes she’d be sitting in math, and suddenly the room would get very far away, like she was underwater. She could still see the teacher’s mouth moving, but the words didn’t feel connected to sound. She called it “going fuzzy.” No one noticed .

At home, she was careful. Too careful. She learned how to move quietly through the hallways, how to read silence like braille. If the TV volume was high, if her mom’s voice had that glassy hum in it, she knew not to go into the living room. She knew to stay small. Small enough not to be seen.

And yet she always was.

Larry had a way of looming without standing. He’d sit on the couch like it was a throne, a beer sweating on the table next to him. His eyes followed her when she walked past. She hated how much she noticed his noticing.

The touches started small—“accidental” brushes, too-long hugs. Then it became something else. Something that split her brain into two halves: the girl who smiled politely, and the one who screamed without sound behind her eyes. She didn’t have words for it yet, but later she’d learn it was called dissociation—a psychological defense where the self floats away to survive .

No one ever asked her if she was okay. She didn’t volunteer the information. She couldn’t. Kids like her knew better. Survivors of intrafamilial abuse often develop avoidant coping strategies, especially when the abuser is a trusted adult and disclosure feels impossible .

She began writing in a notebook she kept hidden under the carpet in her closet. At first it was just lists—words she liked, smells she hated, people she’d seen cry. Then it became more abstract. Phrases that felt like riddles. “My bones are asleep.” “Time smells like beer and toothpaste.” At nine years old, Jane didn’t know it yet, but she was creating her own private lexicon of trauma .

The writing helped. When she was writing, she could be outside the house. Inside herself again. Her sentences were puzzles even she couldn’t solve, but they were hers. She never let anyone read them.

At school, a teacher once handed back an essay on The Velveteen Rabbit and said, “You’re a little philosopher, Jane.” She smiled politely and said thank you. What was she supposed to say? “I think the Rabbit died when the boy stopped pretending, and that’s what happened to my mom?”

She didn’t say things like that. She was already learning that smart girls who act older than they are get called “gifted,” not “traumatized.” No one asks them if they’re scared. They just expect them to do well. To function. To keep being impressive .

And she did. She got straight As. She never skipped class. She learned to fold her body into her desk like a letter no one would open. She didn’t talk to the other kids much. When she did, she was too fast, too sharp, too weird. She used words like “paradox” and “nullify.” One girl said, “You talk like a dictionary.” Jane laughed and never talked to her again.

By the time she turned eleven, Jane knew exactly when to hold her breath and when to speak. She knew how to make herself invisible in her own home. She knew how to disappear.

But she also knew how to observe. How to remember.

She kept writing.

She’s still writing.
