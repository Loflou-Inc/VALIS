PHASE 6 — Internship & Early Career (33–43)
“The Rebuilder”

Jane got her internship placement in a place no one wanted.

Northwest Ohio Psychiatric Hospital. A brutalist brick block on Detroit Street with flickering fluorescents, aging patients, and not enough staff. The walls hummed with trauma and Thorazine. But Jane didn’t mind. It felt familiar. Like a haunted house that never lied about what it was.

She showed up with the same clinical poise she’d cultivated in grad school—sharp skirts, soft voice, all business. But inside, things had started to crack. Again.

By now, the alcohol wasn’t just an afterthought. It was how she marked time. A glass of wine after notes. A bourbon after the ward. Vodka if she needed sleep. Which was most nights.

She hadn’t called it a problem. Not yet.

The work was brutal and oddly sacred. Schizophrenic men muttering about antennas. Women carving words into their thighs. Patients who stared through her like they were looking at a former version of themselves. She felt both maternal and ghostlike. Present, but barely.

Some nights she went home and wrote about them. Not the patients—the ghosts. Her own. In a black Moleskine journal, in handwriting that sometimes turned to loops and scribbles mid-sentence, she tried to make sense of things. She wrote: "You are being trusted now. With others. Do you trust yourself yet?"
(Reflective writing is known to help trauma survivors construct meaning and re-integrate the past into coherent self-narratives .)

Supervision helped, until it didn’t. One day her supervisor asked why she looked so tired. Jane replied, “The human mind is exhausting.” She meant her own.

Then one day a patient relapsed—hard. Self-harm, restraints, the whole sweep. And it rattled Jane more than it should have. She stood in the staff bathroom afterward shaking. It wasn’t the blood that bothered her. It was the voice in the girl’s head: “I’m disgusting. I’ll ruin everyone.” Jane had written that line once. Sophomore year. In lipstick on the mirror.

She left early that day and drank until morning.

Two weeks later, she tried to stop. Just to prove she could. Three days of cold-turkey horror, teeth grinding, skin twitching, memory static. She didn’t go to AA. She tried once—hated it. “Higher Power” made her gag. Everyone in the room sounded like they were auditioning for a morality play.
(Many high-functioning professionals in recovery reject AA’s spiritual or moral frameworks and seek secular, evidence-based alternatives—CBT-based, SMART, or harm-reduction .)

She asked her therapist, “What if I don’t want to give my life to something? What if I just want my life back?”

Her therapist said, “Then we start by not running from it.”

So she stopped drinking. Slowly. Sometimes. And started walking. Long, pointless loops through Toledo’s gray neighborhoods. Headphones in. Wind at her throat. No one knew.

Her colleagues never suspected. She was too sharp. Too clean. That was the trick with high-functioning alcoholics—people only noticed when they collapsed.
(Therapists with addiction histories often hide their struggle due to stigma and fear of professional fallout; many maintain appearances for years before seeking help .)

Jane didn’t collapse. She just… rebooted.

She shifted units, took a quieter caseload. Focused on long-term care patients—less drama, more stillness. She’d sit with patients who said nothing for weeks, and write about them later. How their silence echoed her own. How recovery wasn’t always talking—it was enduring.

Her father got sick around this time. Cirrhosis. Figures.

She visited him in the hospital. He was smaller than she remembered. Puffed up with steroids, skin like wax paper. He cracked a joke about the food. “They think this mush is gonna fix me?”

She didn’t laugh. But she didn’t cry either.

He asked if she was still writing. She nodded.

He said, “You always had something in your head. I never knew what the fuck it was.”

Jane whispered, “It was you. It was always you.”

He didn’t hear her. He was asleep again.

That night she wrote: "I think I forgive him. Not because he deserves it. But because I can’t carry him any farther."
(Adult children of abusive parents often find healing in role reversal and self-forgiveness. Letting go of guilt and recognizing unmet childhood needs are common milestones in late-stage trauma recovery .)

She never told her supervisor about the drinking. Never told her colleagues. But she started making her students write journals. “Not about the clients,” she’d say. “About you. Who you are in the room. What you carry in with you.”

One asked, “Is this like therapy?”

Jane said, “It’s cheaper.”
