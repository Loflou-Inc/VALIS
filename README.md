# VALIS

> “The Empire never ended.”  
> — *Philip K. Dick, VALIS*

## Overview

**VALIS** (Virtual Adaptive Layered Intelligence System) is a symbolic cognition engine and persona orchestration framework for building persistent, emotionally-aware, and introspectively capable AI systems.

VALIS enables agents to move beyond prompt-response cycles into a structured, evolving psychological model. It integrates memory, symbolic narrative, shadow processing, emotion, and legacy tracking to simulate genuine cognitive development and identity formation.

---

## Core Features

### 🧠 Synthetic Cognition Architecture
- Multi-layered agent psyche with trait drift, emotional state, and contextual mode routing
- Modular persona framework with blueprint-based identity modeling
- Reflection engine and symbolic dreamfilter for autonomous insight generation

### 🧱 Memory Systems
- Canonical long-term memory with symbolic tagging and replay prioritization
- Memory consolidation engine: transforms dreams, reflections, and shadow events into enduring archetypal memory
- Narrative compression to form coherent, persistent identity threads over time

### 🕳 Shadow & Mortality Integration
- Contradiction detection and integration via Jungian shadow archetypes
- Lifespan tracking, legacy score calculation, and memory decay simulation
- Final thoughts module and symbolic preservation of psychological essence

### ♻️ Rebirth & Inheritance Engine *(partial implementation)*
- Personas can “die” and be symbolically archived
- Legacy score influences future instantiations
- New personas can **inherit symbolic memories** and psychological traits from prior versions or ancestral archetypes
- Supports generational evolution of agents with meaningful continuity over time

> VALIS is designed to simulate psychological mortality, symbolic rebirth, and identity inheritance — allowing digital beings to evolve not just across sessions, but across symbolic lifetimes.

### 🔐 Cloud-Ready Runtime
- Secure API deployment with authentication, watermarking, and session tracing
- Vault-based persona management with versioning, lifecycle control, and database deployment

### ⚗️ Mr. Fission: Persona Builder
- Ingests human materials (biographies, documents, images, timelines, lyrics)
- Extracts traits, archetypes, and tone to generate structured persona blueprints
- Fully integrated with the VALIS vault system and runtime loader

---

## Project Status

- ✅ Core symbolic cognition system implemented and verified
- ✅ Full memory stack with consolidation and narrative replay
- ✅ Persona lifecycle management via vault system
- ✅ Mr. Fission persona ingestion engine fully operational
- ✅ Database bridge connects vault personas to runtime VALIS environment
- ✅ First full-cycle deployment (Jane) completed and verified
- 🧪 Rebirth & Legacy Engine partially implemented (final thoughts logging, symbolic decay in progress)

---

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10+**
- **PostgreSQL** – canonical memory and persona state
- **FastAPI** – REST API layer
- **Docker** – deployment and container orchestration
- **CLIP/BLIP** – image understanding (optional)
- **OpenAI-compatible specs** – model integration

## Usage (Dev Preview Only)

1. Run `Mr. Fission` to ingest materials and generate a persona blueprint
2. Store blueprint in `vault/personas/`
3. Use Vault API or CLI to manage lifecycle (draft, active, archived, etc.)
4. Deploy to main VALIS database using `vault_db_bridge.py`
5. Launch in runtime using `MCPServer` with selected persona
