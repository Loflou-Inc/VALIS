2. Vault automatically stores with draft status
3. Operator tools enable preview and testing
4. Status updated to active when approved

Deploy Phase:
1. API initiates persona session
2. Activation interface converts to VALIS config
3. Runtime loads persona with memory seeds
4. Dreamfilter applies archetypal transformations

Manage Phase:
1. Session tracking records all interactions
2. Vault maintains version history
3. Operators can fork for variations
4. Lifecycle status controls availability

[STATUS] Sprint 20 Objectives Achieved:
✅ Persona blueprints stored, queryable, and manageable via Vault
