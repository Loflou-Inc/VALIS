# Backup of Redundant Memory System Files

This directory contains backup copies of redundant files from the memory system that were replaced by improved versions:

- `simple_update_memory.py` - Replaced by `smart_update_memory.py`
- `update_memory.bat` - Replaced by `update_memory_smart.bat`
- `update_memory_fixed.bat` - Replaced by `update_memory_smart.bat`

These files were backed up on May 14, 2025 when the memory system was improved to prevent initialization loops.

DO NOT use these files. They are kept only for reference purposes.
