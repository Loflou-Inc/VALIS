# Memory Store Directory

This directory is where memory files are stored. The files include:

- `memories.json` - The main memory file containing all active memories
- `/archive` - Directory containing archived memories 
- `/.chroma` - Directory containing ChromaDB vector database files (if enabled)

Note: The actual memory files are excluded from the repository via .gitignore. This directory is included only for the structure.
