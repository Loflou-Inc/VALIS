## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture**

### Autonomous Planning Flow:
```
User Request → Strategy Detection → Plan Creation → Step Execution → Result Synthesis
     ↓              ↓                   ↓               ↓              ↓
Goal Analysis → Planning Strategy → Tool Chain → Context Update → Final Response
```

### Plan Execution Pipeline:
```
AgentPlanner.create_plan() → Plan Steps → ToolManager.execute_tool() → Results → Response
                    ↓
            Database Persistence → Admin Monitoring → Request Correlation
```

### Provider Integration:
```
Provider Cascade: [autonomous_agent] → mcp_execution → mcp → local_mistral
                         ↓
            Autonomous Mode Detection → Multi-step Planning → Execution
```

- **Tool Execution Linking:** Session logs linked to tool executions
- **Autonomous Plan Correlation:** Plans linked to originating chat sessions
- **Metadata Enhancement:** Processing times, provider info, tool counts tracked

### Database Schema Updates:
```sql
-- Enhanced session_logs table
ALTER TABLE session_logs ADD COLUMN request_id VARCHAR(8);
ALTER TABLE session_logs ADD COLUMN provider_used VARCHAR(50);
ALTER TABLE session_logs ADD COLUMN autonomous_plan_id VARCHAR(8);

-- New session_correlations table
CREATE TABLE session_correlations (
    session_log_id UUID,
    request_id VARCHAR(8),
    plan_id VARCHAR(8),
    correlation_type VARCHAR(30)
);
```

## 🎯 **Autonomous Planning Examples**

### Memory-First Strategy:
```
Goal: "What do you know about coaching techniques?"
Plan:
  1. Query memory for coaching-related content
  2. Analyze retrieved memories for relevance
  3. Generate contextual response based on findings
```

### Tool Chain Strategy:
```
Goal: "Search for Python files and list their contents"
Plan:
  1. List directory contents to find Python files
  2. Analyze search results and file structure
  3. Provide organized summary of findings
```

### Analysis Strategy:
```
Goal: "Analyze the directory structure and compare to best practices"
Plan:
  1. Gather directory information via tools
  2. Perform structural analysis against standards
  3. Generate structured recommendations report
```

- ❌ No multi-step workflow capabilities
- ❌ Tool calls were isolated, not chained
- ❌ No autonomous planning or strategy selection
- ❌ Limited correlation between sessions and tool usage

### After Sprint 10:
- ✅ **Autonomous Agents** - Self-directing with multi-step planning
- ✅ **Workflow Chaining** - Tools executed in strategic sequences
- ✅ **Strategy-Based Planning** - Different approaches for different goals
- ✅ **Complete Traceability** - Request correlation through entire system
- ✅ **Proactive Execution** - Agents plan ahead instead of just responding
