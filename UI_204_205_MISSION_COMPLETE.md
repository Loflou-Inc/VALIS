- Provider usage/failover counts with visual indicators ✅
- Circuit-breaker status visualization ✅
- Auto-refresh every 15 seconds with exponential backoff ✅

**Temporal Disaster Prevention Implemented:**
- ✅ **Polling Performance Catastrophe PREVENTED**
  - Custom `usePollingQuery` hook with exponential backoff
  - Base interval: 15s, backoff: 15s → 30s → 60s → 120s max
  - Automatic polling suspension after 3 failures

- ✅ **State Synchronization Chaos PREVENTED**
  - React Query with proper `staleTime` (5s) and `gcTime` (30s)
  - Memoized data transformations to prevent recalculation
  - Optimized re-renders with `React.memo` throughout

- ✅ **Memory Leakage from Intervals PREVENTED**
  - Automatic cleanup with `useEffect` return functions
  - React Query handles interval cleanup automatically
  - Manual cleanup verification on component unmount

- ✅ **Network Failure Handling IMPLEMENTED**
  - Connection status tracking with `isOnline` state
  - Manual retry functionality with backoff reset
  - Graceful degradation with offline UI state

**Advanced Features:**
- Three-view system: Overview, Sessions, Providers ✅
- Real-time metric cards with status indicators ✅
- Provider status cards with request/failure counts ✅
